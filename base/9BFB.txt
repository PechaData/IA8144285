Entering the Middle Way Chapter 6, verses 1 to 64
With mind settled in meditative equipoise,$Facing towards the perfect Buddha's dharma,$Seeing the reality of dependent arising,$Through abiding in wisdom, one attains cessation.
Just as one person blessed with sight$Can lead with ease a group of blind$To their desired destination bright,$So wisdom takes the qualities confined$Of those without vision pure and clear$And leads them to enlightenment near.
Just as he understood the most profound dharmas$Through both scripture and reasoning's might,$Following Noble Nāgārjuna's tradition thus,$I shall explain them as they truly abide.
Even as an ordinary being, upon hearing emptiness,$Repeated waves of joy arise within.$While tears of devotion moisten the eyes,$And all the hairs upon the body rise.
In whom the seed of Buddha's wisdom dwells,$That one becomes a vessel for reality's teaching true;$To such a one the ultimate truth should be revealed,$And qualities according to that truth ensue.
Always maintaining pure moral discipline,$Practicing generosity and serving with compassion,$Cultivating patience and all these virtuous deeds,$I dedicate entirely for beings' liberation.
One who shows reverence to the Perfect Bodhisattvas,$And is skilled in methods profound and vast,$Shall gradually attain the Level of Joy—$Those who aspire for this, listen well to this path.
That cannot arise from itself, how could it from others?$Not from both sources, nor without any cause.$There is no benefit in arising from itself,$And what is already born cannot logically be born again.
If what is already born is conceived to be born again,$Sprouts and such would never find their arising here;$The seed would keep arising till existence's end,$How then could that very thing bring about its own destruction?
If from the causal seed's distinct functions arise$The sprout's form, color, taste, potency and ripening wise,$When abandoning its former nature entirely,$How can its essence remain true, pray tell me?
If your sprout here is non-different from the seed,$Either the sprout would not be perceived just like the seed,$Or if both are one, then just as this sprout is perceived,$So too should that be - therefore this position cannot be accepted.
Since even when the cause has ceased to be,$Its effect remains for all to see,$Even the world refuses to maintain$That cause and effect are one and the same.$Therefore this notion we must reject:$That things arise from their own aspect—$For such a view cannot be sustained$In ultimate or worldly frame.
If self-causation were to be maintained,$The produced and producer would be one,$The action and agent would be the same.$Since these cannot be identical,$Self-causation must be rejected,$For it leads to extensively explained faults.
If something arose by mere dependence on another,$Then thick darkness would spring forth from blazing fire;$Indeed, everything would arise from everything else,$Since 'otherness' applies equally to all non-producers.
Since it can be effectively produced, it is determined as the result,$That which has the power to generate it is its cause, though different it be;$Due to belonging to single continuum and from its generator it arises,$Unlike a rice sprout [which doesn't arise] from barley and such grains.
Just as barley, stamens and kiṃśuka flowers$Are neither desired nor capable causes,$Neither in the same continuum nor similar,$So too the rice seed isn't its cause, being other.
The sprout and seed do not exist at the same time;$How can the seed be "other" when otherness itself cannot be?$Thus the sprout's production from seed cannot be proved;$Therefore abandon the view of production from other.
Just as the two ends of a balance beam$Cannot rise and fall at the same moment seen,$So too the birth of produced and producer both$Cannot occur at once - this truth holds forth.$If claimed they happen at the selfsame time,$Without simultaneity, such claim can't chime.
If what is being born, facing birth, is not existent,$And what is ceasing, though existent, faces destruction,$How then can this be equal like a scale?$And this birth without an agent is not logical.
If visual consciousness differs from its causes -$The eye and such, occurring simultaneously$With recognition and other factors too -$What purpose serves their presence in this case?$And if no difference exists between the two,$The fault has already been explained before.
If a producer produces something other as its product, that's called a cause,$But does it produce what exists, or what doesn't, or both, or what's free from both?$If it exists, what need is there for producers? If non-existent, what can they do?$For both, what use are they? And for what's free from both, what purpose do they serve?
When people hold their own perception as the valid measure of truth,$What purpose do these logical arguments serve here indeed?$The world naturally understands that things arise from others,$So what need is there for proof of external causation here?
All phenomena bear dual natures twain,$Through correct and false perception gained;$What correct perception sees is truth supreme,$Conventional truth from false perception named.
False perception is accepted as being of two kinds:$Through clear sense faculties and through defective ones.$The knowledge of those with defective faculties$Is deemed wrong in relation to knowledge from healthy senses.
What six unimpaired senses can perceive,$The world accepts as truth indeed;$The rest, by worldly minds conceived,$Is deemed false by the world's own creed.
Those who are stirred by ignorance's sleep,$The non-Buddhist seekers who conceive things in their own way,$And what they imagine regarding illusions and mirages,$All these are non-existent even from the worldly view.
Just as the perception of those with eye disease$Does not invalidate the knowledge of those with clear vision,$Similarly, the understanding of those with clouded minds$Cannot invalidate pure, undefiled wisdom.
Because delusion obscures true nature, it is conventional;$Through it the artificial appears as truth indeed;$The Sage declared this conventional truth,$And all constructed things are merely conventional.
What appears through power of eye disease$As false forms like floating hairs and such,$When seen with pure and perfect sight reveals$Its true nature - understand this truth here thus.
If the world were the authority on truth,$What need would there be for other noble ones?$What purpose would the noble path serve?$Indeed, taking the foolish as authority is not reasonable.
The world is not authoritative in every way,$Thus in matters of ultimate truth, no worldly contradiction exists;$A worldly contradiction would only arise$If worldly objects were negated by worldly conventions themselves.
When merely planting just a seed,$The world declares "I made this child!"$And thinks "This tree I planted too!"$Thus even in the world we see,$No thing is born from something else.
Since the sprout is not other than the seed,$The seed is not destroyed when the sprout exists;$Since they are not one and the same,$We cannot say the seed exists when there is a sprout.
If inherent nature depends on conditions,$Then its denial would destroy phenomena;$Thus emptiness would cause destruction of things—$But this is wrong, hence no inherent existence.
When these phenomena are analyzed thoroughly,$They cannot be found to exist in ultimate reality.$Therefore, one should not analyze$The conventional truths of worldly transactions.
In the realm of ultimate truth, by whatever reasoning$Birth from self and other is proven impossible,$By that very logic, even conventionally it cannot be—$So tell me, how can your theory of birth be possible?
Empty phenomena like reflections and such,$Dependent on conditions, are indeed well-known;$Just as from these empty reflections,$Consciousness arises bearing their form.
Thus, though all phenomena are empty,$They arise from emptiness itself;$Neither annihilated nor eternal are they,$For in both truths, no inherent nature dwells.
Since karma is not destroyed by its inherent nature,$Know that even without the store-consciousness,$Due to its potency, from actions long ceased,$Their fruits can definitely arise.
Just as fools, having seen objects in their dreams,$Even after waking, generate attachment still,$Similarly, though karma lacks inherent nature and has ceased,$Its results continue to manifest and exist.
Just as objects, though equally lacking true existence,$Appear as hair-forms to one with eye disease,$But not as forms of other things,$Know likewise - what's ripened cannot ripen again.
Thus from dark karma comes unwholesome fruit,$While from the good deed, good results ensue;$Through transcending both good and bad one's freed,$Contemplation of karmic fruits we should subdue.
For those who cannot fathom deeper truths,$Teach them thus: "There exists the ground consciousness,$There exists the person, and indeed there are$Nothing but these aggregates alone."
Just as Buddha, free from identity-view,$Still taught using terms like "I" and "mine",$So too did he teach of things' existence$Though they lack inherent nature - as provisional truth sublime.
The Bodhisattva dwelling in perfect wisdom,$Has realized the truth of mere consciousness;$Seeing no grasper divorced from the grasped,$Perceives the three realms as consciousness alone.
Just as waves arise in the great ocean$When stirred by the moving wind,$So from the all-seed base called ālaya,$Consciousness manifests through its own power.
Therefore the dependent nature exists$As basis for conceptually designated things,$Arising without external objects to be grasped,$Real yet beyond conceptual elaborations.
Where does mind exist without external things?$"Just like in dreams," you say? Let's think this through:$When even in my dreams no mind exists,$Your example then proves nothing true.
If mind exists when dreams are recalled on waking,$Then likewise must external objects be existing;$Just as you remember "This I truly saw,"$So too must outer things have real subsisting.
If in sleep, eye consciousness cannot arise,$There exists not [external objects], but mind consciousness alone,$Its forms are grasped as external things,$Just as in dreams, if that's what you maintain.
Just as your external objects are not born in dreams,$Similarly, the mind too remains unborn;$The eye, its objects, and consciousness arising thereof—$All these three are nothing but false.
The remaining three beyond the ear are unborn,$Just as in dreams, so too in waking state;$All things are false, that mind does not exist,$No objects found, no senses can persist.
Just as in one who's fully awake, until awakening$These three appear as real indeed;$Once awakening has been achieved, all three cease to be,$Just as when sleep of ignorance has passed away.
When through an eye disease, consciousness perceives$Hair-like forms appearing by its power,$Relative to that diseased awareness both seem true,$Yet to clear vision both are utterly false.
If consciousness could exist without objects known,$Then like an eye that sees false hairs shown,$Even those with clear sight would perceive$Such floating hairs - but this we don't receive.$Thus consciousness without objects cannot be.
Since for those with pure vision, the power of cognition$Is not matured, therefore no cognition arises in them.$If you say this isn't due to separation from knowable reality,$Then, due to lack of that power, this is not established.
That which is born cannot possess capacity,$That which is unborn has no capacity either;$Without the qualified, no qualifier can exist—$This would apply even to a barren woman's son.
If designation of the future is what you seek,$Without inherent power, no future can there be;$When things depend on mutual support to speak,$The wise declare: "Non-establishment," decree.
If from maturation of ceased potential,$Another's power would give rise to other things,$Since continuums are mutually distinct,$Everything would arise from everything else.
Though the momentary instances there appear distinct,$If you claim their continuum remains the same,$This itself is what needs to be proved first,$For an undifferentiated continuum is not logically sound.
The dharmas based on Maitreya and Upagupta,$Being different, cannot belong to a single continuum;$Those which are distinct by their own characteristics,$Cannot logically belong to a single continuum.
From where the eye-consciousness arises through its own power,$Immediately thereafter that power manifests,$That power which serves as the basis for one's consciousness,$Is conceived as the physical faculty of eye.
